# ColorWise

**ColorWise** is a free, easy-to-use online tool that helps designers and developers ensure their color combinations are accessible based on WCAG guidelines. By inputting two colors, users can quickly check the contrast ratio and get a score to see if their typography is accessible for users with visual impairments.

## Features
- Input two colors and check the contrast ratio.
- Get an accessibility score based on WCAG guidelines.
- Easy-to-use interface for quick accessibility checks.
- Helps ensure designs are inclusive and user-friendly.

## Purpose
The goal of **ColorWise** is to simplify the process of making web content accessible to all users, especially those with visual impairments. Ensuring proper color contrast is an important step toward meeting accessibility standards and improving the user experience for everyone.

## How It Works
1. Enter two color values (hex, RGB, or other formats).
2. The tool calculates the contrast ratio between the colors.
3. The tool displays a score based on WCAG accessibility standards.
4. You can then adjust your colors accordingly to meet accessibility requirements.

## Why ColorWise?
Making digital content accessible to everyone is crucial. **ColorWise** makes it easy to check color contrast and ensure your design complies with WCAG guidelines, providing a better experience for all users.
